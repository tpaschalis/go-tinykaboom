# go-tinykaboom

This is a software *ray marching rendering*. It is a port of [ssloy/tinykaboom](https://github.com/ssloy/tinykaboom/wiki) in Golang.

It's part of [ssloy's](https://github.com/ssloy) *excellent* series of tutorials on graphics. Seriously, he's an outstanding teacher, and has an awesome way of explaining things.

I'll be keeping the convention of going forward one commit at a time, so make sure to check out the diffs.

I need to make sure the color ramp looks okay, and I wish the code to become more idiomatic to Go.

TODO : Modify lerpColor to have ramp up of colors correctly (now its one or the other)
